29/11:
    working on save components and cells and connections of each pin on the output

    NOT WORKING:
        output pin keeps only one connection (fixed)
        some components does not stored in hash (fixed)

    To-Do:
        I need to parse one time to count the sizes

        I need to parse one more time to store the parent comp on each pin,
        and to store pins in libhash (done)
        Make all structs with haspresent instead of string == NULL
        Make gatepinhash with static HASHDEPTH instead of memory allocation



    CAUTION: the maximum length size is 15000

    Maybe on lpffir there are 402 cells, NOT 487

30/11:
    working all structs
    all structs has all the values
    i fixed a problem that some pins and components kept in name '\n' in the end
    i created a new function in gatepinhash that when parsing finishes it adds all 
    parent components in the field in gatepinhash
    i parsed a second time the input to store all pins of cells

    ToDo:
        Find a way to check the values of each struct correct
        Parse one more time input to initialize the structs sizes
        Make gatepinhash struct with HASHDEPTH instead of dynamically
        transport all this in TCL SHELL

02/11:
    Everything works fine
    All functions are correct for every design

    ToDo:
       Parse one more time input to initialize the structs sizes 
       check valgrind again for memory leaks
       check each result of function to do all printf in TCL
