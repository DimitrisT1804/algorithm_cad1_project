29/11:
    working on save components and cells and connections of each pin on the output

    NOT WORKING:
        output pin keeps only one connection (fixed)
        some components does not stored in hash (fixed)

    To-Do:
        I need to parse one time to count the sizes

        I need to parse one more time to store the parent comp on each pin,
        and to store pins in libhash
        Make all structs with haspresent instead of string == NULL
        Make gatepinhash with static HASHDEPTH instead of memory allocation



    CAUTION: the maximum length size is 10000

    Maybe on lpffir there are 402 cells, NOT 487
