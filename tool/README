# HW1 for algorithm Cad 1 #
# Create a TCL shell that supports tab-completion for custom, system and TCL commands #
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To compile this one just type: "gcc -Wall -g tcl_shell.c -o tcl_shell -lreadline -ltcl"
You need to link libraries of Readline and TCL for correct compilation

Run program and check for memory leaks and memory violations using Valgrind
ex: "valgrind --leak-check=full ./tcl_shell"

The result that you get seems to have violations, but if you analyze it
you can see that there are memory leaks and errors, only in Tcl_CreateInterp
which is from TCL library and not from my implementation
